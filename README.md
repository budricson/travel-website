<h1 align="left">Building a travel website</h1>

During my 6 weeks at Maiona Coding, our final project was to create a personal travel website.


<h2>Objective </h2>
The travel website should have a navigation bar that will direct users to different pages. One of these pages must include a booking form.

<h2>Project Outcome </h2>
In this course, I learned the languages that developers use to build webpages:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

<h2>Result</h2>
